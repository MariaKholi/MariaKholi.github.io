Some websites like Facebook introduced Open Graph to promote integration between the websites by allowing them to become rich “graph” objects with the same functionality as other Facebook objects.

In order to make this possible, information is sent via Open Graph meta tags in the <head> part of the website’s code. like this:  {% include open-graph.html %}
